    <p>Welcome to Bob's Reviews.  I'm Bob and i've always had a love 
        for pizza and am always looking for a better place to get a hot pie.
        This got me thinking......what would be nice is to have a website
        that allows people to add and review pizza places as they come.  This
        website will hopefully spur people do just that, while hopefully steering
        us all away from the terrible pie places.
